# PoissonReconPackage
This project is based on [Screened Poisson Surface Reconstruction Version 5](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~misha/Code/PoissonRecon/Version5/).
The latest code is released on [this repository](https://github.com/mkazhdan/PoissonRecon) and [this page](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~misha/Code/PoissonRecon/). Many thanks to Professor [Michael Kazhdan](https://github.com/mkazhdan) and all contributors for introducing all these amazing algorithms and codes.

This project is a demo to show how to use PoissonRecon and SurfaecTrimmer in your own project, with STL vector of float*/int* as input and output.
